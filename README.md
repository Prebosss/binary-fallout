# Binary Fallout

In the year 2099, reality has broken down, fractured by a rogue cascade of corrupted code. Time glitches, landscapes distort, and the simulation holding Earth together is falling apart. In response, an emergency protocol known as Project: 404-EARTH activates.

You play as a UCF student, armed with knowledge from the Foundation Exam. Your mission: draw cards from the Knightmare Deck, a set of cards infused with core CS1 concepts. Each card has a challenge question regarding algorithms, data structures, or bitwise operators/bit conversion and dynamic memory allocation problems. Your success in solving them is the only way to patch the code, stabilize the world, and restore the fabric of existence!
